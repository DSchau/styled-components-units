# Getting Started with styled-components

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (INSTRUCTIONS) -->

This project is distributed as a monorepo utilizing [yarn workspaces][workspaces]

As such, the best course of action is to navigate to the root of this repo, and run `yarn`. This will install all the necessary dependencies and get you up and running with styled-components and React!

Once dependencies are installed:

1.  `cd projects/01-getting-started-with-styled-components`
1.  `yarn start` to start the local development server
1.  Make changes in `src`, and the project will automatically reload!
