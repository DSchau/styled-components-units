# Vue Example

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (INSTRUCTIONS) -->

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is distributed as a monorepo utilizing [yarn workspaces][workspaces]

As such, the best course of action is to navigate to the root of this repo, and simply type the following command:

```bash
yarn
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies and get you up and running with styled-components and React!

Once dependencies are installed:

1.  `cd projects/15-automated-tooling/vue-example/`
1.  `yarn start` to start the local development server
1.  Make changes in `src`, and the project will automatically reload!

### 🤔 Alternative Approach

[CodeSandbox][code-sandbox] is a great, online IDE that can simplify some of the pain of getting set up locally.
