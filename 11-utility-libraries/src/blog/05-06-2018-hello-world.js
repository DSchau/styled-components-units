# CSS in JS

This is intended to be a relatively stream-of-conciousness exposition of what I love so much about CSS in JS.

First and foremost, I think it's abundantly obvious that there are some implicit benefits of one of the first implementations of CSS in JS: inline styles.

However, for a variety of what I would say are _crucial_ downfalls, inline styles are not what I'd consider the **best** implementation of CSS in JS.

Introducing... styled-components!

[styled-components][styled-components] is the first CSS in JS library where it really clicked and where I felt writing CSS as CSS in JS to be natural, intuitive, and clean. The authoring experience is top-notch and I really do believe it to still be one of the best CSS in JS libraries in the React ecosystem.
